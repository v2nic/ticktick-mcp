# TickTick MCP Agent Guidelines

- **MCP tools and documentation**

  - Whenever you modify an MCP tool (signature, behavior, or parameters), update both the tool's docstring and any user-facing documentation that describes the tool (for example, the README tools table).

- **Tool design principles**
  - Prefer fewer, more powerful MCP tools over many narrowly-scoped ones. When possible, extend an existing tool with additional options instead of introducing a separate tool that overlaps in behavior.
